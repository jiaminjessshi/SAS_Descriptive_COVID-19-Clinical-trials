** Scenario
* Problem: At the 1st time of loading the original dataset, there were more than 1,000 empty columns.
* Solution: Found a macro online which could keep the 1st 27 meaningful columns. 

** Macro description
* This macro allows you to specify the index of the 1st variable, the index of the last variable to keep, library name, and name of the new dataset formed

** Macro creation
%macro drop_vars(num_first_vars, num_end_vars, lib, dataset); %macro d;%mend d;

proc sql noprint;;
    select sum(num_character,num_numeric) into:ncolumns 
    from dictionary.tables 
    where libname=upcase("&lib") and memname=upcase("&dataset");
    select name into: vars_to_drop separated by ',' 
    from dictionary.columns 
    where libname=upcase("&lib") and 
          memname=upcase("&dataset") and
          varnum between %eval(&num_first_vars.+1) and %eval(&ncolumns-&num_end_vars);
   alter table &lib..&dataset
   drop &vars_to_drop;
quit;

%mend drop_vars;

** Ex use
* Keep the 1st 27 columns (27, 0), the library name is cct, and the newly formed dataset is ct. 
%drop_vars(27, 0, cct, ct);
